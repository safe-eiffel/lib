	* Port to 64 bits:
		Reviewed External API.
		Experimented with inlining C code.
		
	!! On 64 bits platform, the size of the data is expressed in 64 bits; 
	   However ECLI has an limited the size of data to 32 bits to stay compatible with 32 bits implementation.

	* Support for smallint - INTEGER_16

2011-12-22	pgcrism
	* [FIX] Added environment Variables ODBC32LIBPATH and 
		ODBCCP32LIBPATH to cope with Windows SDK7.1 linking error - 
		
		"The ODBC team investigated and confirmed that the issue exists in the version of ODBCCP32.LIB that 
		is included with Visual Studio 2010 and the Windows 7 SDK. 
		Two workarounds are currently available. 
		One is using /MD instead of /MT. 
		The other is to use the version of ODBCCP32.LIB from the Vista SDK. 
		I hope one of these workarounds will help you.
		Mike Robinson
		Program Manager
		Windows SDK Team"
		
		The added environment variables allow one to use the Vista SDK libraries. (This solution is fully working).

		TODO:
		 use those environment variables to target the SDK 6 librarires

	                 -force_string = all character data are declared as ECLI_STRING_LONGVARCHAR (no fixed lenght anymore)

2009-03-05

	* Support of multiple result sets : go_after finishes sweeping through the current result-set, finish finishes sweeping through all pending result sets.
	* New connection protocol, using an ECLI_LOGIN_STRATEGY whith descendants
	  - ECLI_SIMPLE_LOGIN (data source name, user name, password)
	  - ECLI_DRIVER_LOGIN (using a connection string and possibly a windowed dialog)
	* New ECLI_DRIVERS_CURSOR and ECLI_DRIVER classes.

2003-07-04
	* ECLI_VALUE.as_* replace now ECLI_VALUE.to_* conversion routines
		Original routines are make obsolete
	* ECLI_VALUE.convertible_as_* replace now ECLI_VALUE.convertible_to* routines
		Original routines are made obsolete
	
2003-05-05
!!!	* ECLI_VALUE.as_string now *replaces* ECLI_VALUE.to_string to ensure .NET compatibility
	* Transaction isolation

		- read/write implemented by ECLI_SESSION.transaction_isolation and ECLI_SESSION.set_transaction_isolation
	* ECLI_TIMESTAMP.decimal_digits is now 0, unless specifically set through ECLI_TIMESTAMP.set_decimal_digits
	* Prepared migration of ECLI to .NET : created support for external values
	  with classes XS_C_*; This prevents using the '$' operator.
	* Query assistant heavily reworked, still in alpha state.
	
2003-03-10
	* ECLI_VALUE descendants implement correct 'copy' and 'is_equal' features.	  
	
2003-02-28
	* 'metadata' cluster provides various cursors on metadata : tables, columns, types, procedures,
	  primary keys, foreign keys, data sources, ...

	* clisql now is a real command line interactive sql, useful in production environments
	
!!!	* ECLI_VALUE and its heirs have been revisited.  ECLI_GENERIC_VALUE [G] is a proper descendant
	  with feature 'item' that can be expanded or not.  If 'item' is a reference, it always is the
	  same reference -> beware of aliasing problems.
	                  **** WARNING **** 
	                  *****************
	  ECLI_VALUE descendants 'item' features that return a reference
	  always return the SAME reference. BEWARE OF ALIASING PROBLEMS.
	  THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE with respect to THE PREVIOUS SEMANTICS.
	
	* Reviewed sample applications :
		'test1' does not use manifest arrays anymore (to prevent runtime problems with SmartEiffel)
		'test_rowset' has been revisited to show how error handling could be done; more useful messages.
		'isql' has been renamed 'clisql' to prevent name clashes with other known tools.
		'test_values' can check good behavior of ECLI_VALUE and ECLI_ARRAYED_VALUE heir classes

	* Corrected problem with ECLI_STATEMENT.parameters_count when there were parameters without name
	* ECLI_ARRAYED_VALUE.set_null is now correctly redefined
	* ECLI_ARRAYED_BUFFER_FACTORY.value_factory is not a 'once' function anymore.  It is now a simulated "once per object".
	* ECLI_ROWSET_CURSOR.row_count is bound and updated within 'fetch_next_row'.  GC is temporarily disabled to avoid problems with moving GCs.
	* Various pre/post-conditions fixed/updated
