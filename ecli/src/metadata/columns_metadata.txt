Column name	Column number	Data type	Comments
TABLE_CAT
(ODBC 1.0)	1	Varchar	Catalog name; NULL if not applicable to the data source. If a driver supports catalogs for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, it returns an empty string ("") for those tables that do not have catalogs.
TABLE_SCHEM
(ODBC 1.0)	2	Varchar 	Schema name; NULL if not applicable to the data source. If a driver supports schemas for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, it returns an empty string ("") for those tables that do not have schemas.
TABLE_NAME
(ODBC 1.0)	3	Varchar not NULL	Table name.
COLUMN_NAME
(ODBC 1.0)	4	Varchar not NULL	Column name. The driver returns an empty string for a column that does not have a name.
DATA_TYPE
(ODBC 1.0)	5	Smallint not NULL	SQL data type. This can be an ODBC SQL data type or a driver-specific SQL data type. For datetime and interval data types, this column returns the concise data type (such as SQL_TYPE_DATE or SQL_INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_MONTH, rather than the non-concise data type such as SQL_DATETIME or SQL_INTERVAL). For a list of valid ODBC SQL data types, see “SQL Data Types” in Appendix D, “Data Types.” For information about driver-specific SQL data types, see the driver’s documentation.The data types returned for ODBC 3.0 and ODBC 2.x applications may be different. For more information, see “Backward Compatibility and Standards Compliance” in Chapter 17, “Programming Considerations.”
TYPE_NAME
(ODBC 1.0)	6	Varchar not NULL	Data source–dependent data type name; for example, “CHAR”, “VARCHAR”, “MONEY”, “LONG VARBINAR”, or “CHAR ( ) FOR BIT DATA”.
COLUMN_SIZE
(ODBC 1.0)	7	Integer	If DATA_TYPE is SQL_CHAR or SQL_VARCHAR, then this column contains the maximum length in characters of the column. For datetime data types, this is the total number of characters required to display the value when converted to characters. For numeric data types, this is either the total number of digits or the total number of bits allowed in the column, according to the NUM_PREC_RADIX column. For interval data types, this is the number of characters in the character representation of the interval literal (as defined by the interval leading precision, see “Interval Data Type Length” in Appendix D, “Data Types”). For more information, see “ Column Size, Decimal Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size”  in Appendix D, “Data Types.”
BUFFER_LENGTH
(ODBC 1.0)	8	Integer	The length in bytes of data transferred on an SQLGetData, SQLFetch, or SQLFetchScroll operation if SQL_C_DEFAULT is specified. For numeric data, this size may be different than the size of the data stored on the data source. This value is the same as the COLUMN_SIZE column for character or binary data. For more information about length, see “Column Size, Decimal Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size” in Appendix D, “Data Types.”
DECIMAL_DIGITS
(ODBC 1.0)	9	Smallint	The total number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point. For SQL_TYPE_TIME and SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP, this column contains the number of digits in the fractional seconds component. For the other data types this is the decimal digitsof the column on the data source. For interval data types that contain a time component, this column contains the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (fractional seconds). For interval data types that do not contain a time component, this column is 0. For more information on decimal digits, see “Column Size, Decimal Digits, Transfer Octet Length, and Display Size” in Appendix D, “Data Types.” NULL is returned for data types where decimal digits is not applicable.
NUM_PREC_RADIX
(ODBC 1.0)	10	Smallint	For numeric data types, either 10 or 2. If it is 10, the values in COLUMN_SIZE and DECIMAL_DIGITS give the number of decimal digits allowed for the column. For example, a DECIMAL(12,5) column would return a NUM_PREC_RADIX of 10, a COLUMN_SIZE of 12, and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of 5; A FLOAT column could return a NUM_PREC_RADIX of 10, a COLUMN_SIZE of 15 and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of NULL.If it is 2, the values in COLUMN_SIZE and DECIMAL_DIGITS give the number of bits allowed in the column. For example, a FLOAT column could return a RADIX of 2, a COLUMN_SIZE of 53, and a DECIMAL_DIGITS of NULL.NULL is returned for data types where NUM_PREC_RADIX is not applicable.
NULLABLE
(ODBC 1.0)	11	Smallint not NULL	SQL_NO_NULLS if the column could not include NULL values.SQL_NULLABLE if the column accepts NULL values.SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN if it is not known whether the column accepts NULL values.The value returned for this column is different than the value returned for the IS_NULLABLE column. The NULLABLE column indicates with certainty that a column can accept NULLs, but cannot indicate with certainty that a column does not accept NULLs. The IS_NULLABLE column indicates with certainty that a column cannot accept NULLs, but cannot indicate with certainty that a column accepts NULLs.
REMARKS
(ODBC 1.0)	12	Varchar	A description of the column.
COLUMN_DEF
(ODBC 3.0)	13	Varchar	The default value of the column. The value in this column should be interpreted as a string if it is enclosed in quotation marks.If NULL was specified as the default value, then this column is the word NULL, not enclosed in quotation marks. If the default value cannot be represented without truncation, then this column contains TRUNCATED, with no enclosing single quotation marks. If no default value was specified, then this column is NULL.The value of COLUMN_DEF can be used in generating a new column definition, except when it contains the value TRUNCATED.
SQL_DATA_TYPE
(ODBC 3.0)	14	Smallint not NULL	SQL data type, as it appears in the SQL_DESC_TYPE record field in the IRD. This can be an ODBC SQL data type or a driver-specific SQL data type. This column is the same as the DATA_TYPE column, with the exception of datetime and interval data types. This column returns the non-concise data type (such as SQL_DATETIME or SQL_INTERVAL), rather than the concise data type (such as  SQL_TYPE_DATE or SQL_INTERVAL_YEAR_TO_
MONTH) for datetime and interval data types. If this column returns SQL_DATETIME or SQL_INTERVAL, the specific data type can be determined from the SQL_DATETIME_SUB column. For a list of valid ODBC SQL data types, see “SQL Data Types” in Appendix D, “Data Types.” For information about driver-specific SQL data types, see the driver’s documentation.The data types returned for ODBC 3.0 and ODBC 2.x applications may be different. For more information, see “Backward Compatibility and Standards Compliance” in Chapter 17, “Programming Considerations.”
SQL_DATETIME_
SUB
(ODBC 3.0)	15	Smallint	The subtype code for datetime and interval data types. For other data types, this column returns a NULL. For more information about datetime and interval subcodes, see “SQL_DESC_DATETIME_
INTERVAL_CODE” in SQLSetDescField.
CHAR_OCTET_
LENGTH
(ODBC 3.0)	16	Integer	The maximum length in bytes of a character or binary data type column. For all other data types, this column returns a NULL.
ORDINAL_
POSITION
(ODBC 3.0)	17	Integer not NULL	The ordinal position of the column in the table. The first column in the table is number 1.
IS_NULLABLE
(ODBC 3.0)	18	Varchar	“NO” if the column does not include NULLs.“YES” if the column could include NULLs.This column returns a zero-length string if nullability is unknown. ISO rules are followed to determine nullability. An ISO SQL-compliant DBMS cannot return an empty string. The value returned for this column is different than the value returned for the NULLABLE column. (See the description of the NULLABLE column.)
