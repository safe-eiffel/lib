Makefile for lcc-win32, but with modified ODBC/CLI V3.0 headers coming from www.unixodbc.org
It also works with MS headers.  The unixodbc ones (modified) are provided because they are open source.


To install : 

If you have MS nmake then use command
	nmake -f makefile.mak
Else use command
	make.bat
