1) Document

The main concept is the "Document" (PDF_DOCUMENT).
It is the creator of every PDF 'object'.

The most visible constituent of a document is the set of its pages.
The pages are contained in a tree-structure made of PDF_PAGES.
Every individual page (PDF_PAGE) has a pages-tree parent.

The non-visible constituents of a Document mostly are some kind of
resources or parameters : fonts, default media size, ...

2) Page
Every single page is constituted by one ore more streams (PDF_STREAM) of graphical operations.

Non graphical attributes are the page's own media size.

??? Description by "needs" (non-yagni).
- create a document
- set various document level attributes
	* fonts (find_font) -OK-
	* default page size
- (DONE) The concept of "pages" (i.e. pages tree node) does not need to be exposed.
  Pages can generated "on the fly" during the to_pdf conversion.
  This is more interesting since it can produce balanced trees.
   (need to examine an algorithm for that)
   
* Symbol + ZapfDingbats encodings ! -OK-

- create a page
- set various text or graphics state attributes (select a font font the page)
	* set_font (PDF_FONT, size) -OK-
	
- draw on the page
- create another page
- finish the document (print it)

(Yagni?) Page attribute that are inheritable from a pages tree node :
	- Resources
	- MediaBox
	- CropBox
	- Rotate
	
Justification :
Count the number of words in line (word_count) and adjust the character spacing :
character_spacing = (box width - line width) / word_count


!!! There is no need to bother people with streams...
