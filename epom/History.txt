EPOM V1.?
	. Added LRU_CACHE so that it's possible not to care about flushing caches.
	. Fixes for ECMA-367 compliance
	
EPOM V1.2
	. Added PO_CACHE, which is deferred and allows for different implementations. 
	. PO_HASHED_CACHE implements a cache with a hash-table.
	. All ECLI*SKELETON are adapted so that they use a PO_HASHED_CACHE.  
	. Suppressed feature `cache' from PO_ADAPTER.
	. PO_MANAGER.add_adapter : post_condition changed.
	. ECLI_ADAPTER_REFRESH_SKELETON.refresh: postcondition ensured (object_fresh: not status.is_error implies not object.is_modified).
